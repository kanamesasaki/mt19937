# mt19937

This is an OpenGL ES 3.0 implementation of the Merseene Twister algorithm. The purpose is to generate and use reliable pseudorandom numbers in GPU through the WebGL 2.0 interface. The implementation is based on the C code "mt19937ar.c" presented in the [Mersenne Twister Home Page](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/m-mat/MT/emt.html).
